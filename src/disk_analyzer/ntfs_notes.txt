I don't know how to bootstrap a partition yet.

Supposedly right after the boot sector (512 bytes in) there is a Master File
Table which contain metadata for all files in NTFS.  Even metadata is stored as
files (cool, possibly simpler reading/writing).  

Issues: the attributes used in the MFT are defined in an attribute file.

I am currently unsure of the correct method of finding and reading the
attribute file in the face of variable length attributes.
