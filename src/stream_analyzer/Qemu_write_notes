Block device current tracing (for us, ignoring VirtIO):

bdrv_co_io_em ->
bdrv_aio_writev -->
bdrv_aio_rw_vector ->
bdrv_co_do_writev

At the level of bdrv_write everything has been deserialized out into the raw
binary buffer and arguments we want to log.

Hooked into the ./scripts/tracetool shell script to specifically output the
exact binary data we want in our stream for format string "raw".

Many of the functions here are _em or emulated, should hook above them in the
future.
