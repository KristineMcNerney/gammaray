Backtracing from 'bdrv_co_writev':

BlockDriverState: "raw" format drive

coroutine_trampoline ->
    bdrv_co_do_rw ->
        bdrv_co_do_writev ->
            raw_co_writev (block/raw.c) ->
                **bdrv_co_writev

The "raw" format is generic and switches to a "file" backend (I think only
POSIX and win 32 exist).

BlockDriverState: "file" format (block/raw-posix.c)

                bdrv_co_do_writev ->
                    bdrv_co_writev_em ->
                        bdrv_aio_writev ->
                            raw_aio_submit ->
                                    paio_submit or laio_submit
                                aio_threads (thread pool?) ->
                                    pwritev


The "meta"-bdrv events seem to occur in a single thread.


virtio comes in with

    virtio_submit_multiwrite ->
            "raw" format drive
        bdrv_aio_multiwrite ->
            bdrv_aio_writev ->
                bdrv_co_aio_rw_vector ->
                    bdrv_co_do_rw -> (NEW COROUTINE CREATED, jmp with GDB
                                      getting lost)
                        bdrv_co_do_writev -> AS BEFORE
